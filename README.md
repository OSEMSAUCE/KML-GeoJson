*Geojson Converter*

Maps are cool, but they're so cool that developers get very distracted with what's really important. 
Our job is very, very simple. So simple that it might be better if a non-geography dev or analyst does it.

We need only the *polygons*. 

- A polygon is a shape, drawn by connecting the dots (gps points). It could have 3 corners, just 3 gps points. Or 5,000 data points (hopefully not!).
- Polygons come in different formats of data. The format we want we wanna use is **GeoJson**. 
- Another easy format is **KML**
- There's also Shape files which are much more difficult to manage because of proprietary and costly ArcGIS software.
- We simply want the polygons to load onto our map. The polygon may however, have some metadata, and if possible preserve that metadata, along with the shape.
- Here is an ([example of the formats](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vBWcN2G2ByaEwRjLUQlDajLVIcmTxGXJ?usp=sharing))
